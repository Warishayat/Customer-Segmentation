# Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering

This project focuses on customer segmentation for a supermarket mall using KMeans clustering. The goal is to identify target customers for effective marketing strategies based on their demographic and purchasing behavior.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Data Preprocessing

1. Load the dataset using pandas.
2. Inspect and clean the data, handling any missing values.
3. Select relevant features for clustering (e.g., Age, Annual Income, Spending Score).
4. Standardize the data using `StandardScaler` from `sklearn`.

## Clustering Method

We use the KMeans algorithm for clustering:

1. **Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters**: We utilize the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters by plotting the Within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters.
2. **Fit the KMeans Model**: Based on the optimal number of clusters determined, we fit the KMeans model and assign cluster labels to each customer.

## Visualization

Visualizations are created to better understand the clusters:

- **Elbow Method Plot**: Displays the WCSS to identify the optimal number of clusters.
- **Scatter Plot**: Visualizes the clusters based on Annual Income and Spending Score.

## Results

After running the analysis, the clusters are summarized, providing insights into different customer segments. These insights can help inform marketing strategies.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation.git
   cd customer-segmentation
   ```

2. Update the dataset path in the script if necessary.
3. Run the Python script to perform customer segmentation:
   ```bash
   python customer_segmentation.py
   ```
